# This workflow will run pytest.
#
# There are three jobs which run in parallel:
# 1. pytest-fast: Run fast tests only, and fail fast so the dev knows asap if they broke something.
# 2. pytest-no-creds: Run tests only if they don't require creds. The main use case is to run tests
#    on forks, where secrets are not available. We flush the GCP_GSM_CREDENTIALS env var to an
#    invalid value to ensure that tests that require creds are not run.
# 3. pytest: Run all tests, across multiple python versions.
#
# Note that pytest-fast also skips tests that require credentials, allowing it to run on forks.
