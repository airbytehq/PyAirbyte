# This workflow will run pytest.
#
# There are two jobs which run in parallel:
# 1. pytest-fast: Run fast tests only, and fail fast so the dev knows asap if they broke something.
# 2. pytest: Run all tests, across multiple python versions.
#
# Note that pytest-fast also skips tests that require credentials, allowing it to run on forks.
